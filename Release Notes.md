[krail 353](https://github.com/*davidsowerby/krail/issues/353) Vaadin 7.4.2*

Updated tests.  Had to undo the fix of [152](https://github.com/davidsowerby/krail-bench/issues/152), as it was causing mock to fail for VaadinSession.  Raised a new ticket [354](https://github.com/davidsowerby/krail-bench/issues/354).
rechecked and eliminated some 'force' statements in the Gradle ResolutionStrategy
